# KnowTopiaâ„¢ - QuizApp

Submission for my course project exam. I created an interactive QuizApp where I fetched different categories and questions by using the OpenTrivia API. 

This was good practice for my vanilla JS knowledge aswell as manipulating the DOM. 

I created a total of 3 Quiz Apps, I couldn't really reach the desired results I had in mind with the other two which I spent most time on. I am submitting this one just because it fits with all the needed criteria to pass this exam. 

I was struggling with the other two quiz apps, you can find one of them in my previous repo to see how far I got. I hope that I can go back in the future when I feel confident enought to overcome all the issues I stumbled upon.

------------------------

# Things I did:

- I fetched questions/categories from an API
- I used localStorage to save and store users highScores. Parsed it to JS to create a "Leaderboard" that user can access. 
- I set a timer of 15s per each question using the setInterval
- I put real-time feedback after user pressed an answer to show if it was correct/incorrect using different colors.

-------------------------

# Conclusion: 

- It was way harder than I thought it would be.
- I was humbled by the code many times.
- Lots of logic in JavaScript for a complete beginner, this is a great project to improve your fundamentals which I now understand why it is gonna be so important in the future.
- Learned that JavaScript is King of Web Dev.
